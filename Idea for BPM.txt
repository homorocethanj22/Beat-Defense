Idea for BPM

pulsing icon that lets the player know what the bpm is
if player taps along to the bpm they do extra damage?

let each tile be a beat and adjust the enemy's speed to cross each tile based off of the song's bpm.
this way we can let the player place the instruments wherever they want since each tile is a beat.
